Launch GitHub Desktop. Click on File and select New repository to create a folder on your local drive.
Type a name for your repository (without spaces), select the local path (the repository will be created in Documents -> GitHub by default), and click on Create repository.
Extract your SCORM archive on your local drive. You’ll need to find the HTML file that launches your course. It is usually named “index.” If it has another name, you’ll need to manually rename it to index and then copy all the content inside the archive. We’re uploading a course created with iSpring Suite here, so there is a small difference. The index file in our SCORM archive is hidden in the res subfolder. So, we need to open the “res” subfolder and copy only the files that are inside it.
Open the created repository folder on your local drive and paste the copied files here.
Return to GitHub Desktop. You’ll see the copied files on the left. You need to enter a summary and click on Commit to main.
Click on Publish repository.
Under the GitHub.com tab, deselect the Keep this code private checkbox. Click on Publish repository.
Open your GitHub account in the browser. Go to the Repositories tab and select your published repository.
You should see your files under the Code tab.
Go to the Settings tab and select Pages. You need to select Branch field -> main with the root folder. Click on Save.
You may need to wait several minutes and refresh the page a couple of times before the URL link to your course will be generated. You’ll see it at the top of the page.
Copy this link and paste it into the address bar in a browser. Your course will then be uploaded.
